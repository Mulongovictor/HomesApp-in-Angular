# HomesApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.5.

Git clone into this repository https://github.com/Mulongovictor/HomesApp-in-Angular.git and run the application on your local machine.

First have Angular installed on your machine with the steps below:
Install node.js from nodejs official website https://nodejs.org/en/download/ 

With node.js and npm installed, the next step is to install the Angular CLI which provides tooling for effective Angular development.

From a Terminal window run the following command: npm install -g @angular/cli.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## The Json server
Install the json server with this command: npm install -g json-server
In the directory of db.json file run this command: json-server --watch db.json
In your web browser, navigate to the http://localhost:3000/locations and confirm that the response includes the data stored in db.json

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
